/interfaces
1. UCI
- process_command

/engine
1. EngineController
- search_thread
- init_position: creates board
- start_search: need to fork into new thread, passing board as data (ownership ?).  Also tracks remaining time allowed
and stops the existing search when time elapses or stop signal received from GUI
- stop_search: called by process_command or by start_search when time elapses.  Need to send signal to the currently-
searching thread (using a reference to it)


2. MinimaxSearch
- search_from_position(pos: Position): calls get_legal_moves(), builds tree, recurses to max depth, calls evaluate_position,
performs minimax + alpha-beta pruning


3. PositionEvaluator
- evaluate_position(pos: Position) -> f32: do some magic and return a float for each position


/game
1. Position: stores bitboards for each piece type, lists of each piece + its location
- from_fen(): generate position from FEN string
- get_legal_moves()
